    "text": "Derrick Henry, The King, El Tractorcito\n\n\nImagine if you will. You are a Tennessean living in Nebraska and you hail from the Country Music Capital of the World and you’re favorite professional sports team is actually having a good year! Most of the teams in the state are having a good year for once which is a nice change. You are taking some sports journalism classes and you have been tasked with writing your first big piece for the sports paper and you figure, “Hey, my Tennessee Titans are pretty hot right now and my favorite player The King, El Tractorcito, number 22 is absolutely demolishing the rushing charts. How about I write the story of the MVP lock that is Derick Henry?” Well, that would be me, exactly four days before those hopes and dreams of a Titans MVP and potential Superbowl went down the drain after Derrick Henry was injured and ruled out for multiple weeks after a match up against the conference rivals (if you can call it that) Houston Texans.’\nIn a “broadcasters jinx” style of unfortunate circumstances that I still am convinced that I caused, we will cover the unfortunate story of the NFL MVP campaign that never was. This is how Derrick Henry was shorted the single season rushing record and how he compares to other running back MVPS in the 21st century\nSo, through the eight games that Derrick Henry played in the Titans regular season, he put up 987 yards through the first eight games. And despite played the least amount of games in the best group of rushers in the NFL, Henry still ended up just outside the top 10 rushers for the 2021 season.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(nflreadr)\nlibrary(nflplotR)\nlibrary(ggbump)\n\ndata2021<- load_pbp(2021)\n\n\nDerrickHenry<-\n  data2021 %>% \n  filter(rusher_player_name == \"D.Henry\" & season_type != \"POST\") %>% \n  group_by(rusher_player_name,week) %>% \n  summarise(WeeklyYards = sum(yards_gained)) %>% \n  mutate(CumulativeYards = cumsum(WeeklyYards))\n\nJohnathanTaylor<-\n  data2021 %>% \n  filter(rusher_player_name == \"J.Taylor\"& season_type != \"POST\")%>% \n  group_by(rusher_player_name,week) %>% \n  summarise(WeeklyYards = sum(yards_gained))%>% \n  mutate(CumulativeYards = cumsum(WeeklyYards))\nNickChubb<-\n  data2021 %>% \n  filter(rusher_player_name == \"N.Chubb\" & season_type != \"POST\")%>% \n  group_by(rusher_player_name,week) %>% \n  summarise(WeeklyYards = sum(yards_gained))%>% \n  mutate(CumulativeYards = cumsum(WeeklyYards))\nJoeMixon<-\n  data2021 %>% \n  filter(rusher_player_name == \"J.Mixon\" & season_type != \"POST\")%>% \n  group_by(rusher_player_name,week) %>% \n  summarise(WeeklyYards = sum(yards_gained))%>% \n  mutate(CumulativeYards = cumsum(WeeklyYards))\nNajeeHarris<-\n  data2021 %>% \n  filter(rusher_player_name == \"N.Harris\" & season_type != \"POST\")%>% \n  group_by(rusher_player_name,week) %>% \n  summarise(WeeklyYards = sum(yards_gained))%>% \n  mutate(CumulativeYards = cumsum(WeeklyYards))\nDalvinCook<-\n  data2021 %>% \n  filter(rusher_player_name == \"D.Cook\" & season_type != \"POST\")%>% \n  group_by(rusher_player_name,week) %>% \n  summarise(WeeklyYards = sum(yards_gained))%>% \n  mutate(CumulativeYards = cumsum(WeeklyYards))\nAJGibson<-\n  data2021 %>% \n  filter(rusher_player_name == \"A.Gibson\" & season_type != \"POST\")%>% \n  group_by(rusher_player_name,week) %>% \n  summarise(WeeklyYards = sum(yards_gained))%>% \n  mutate(CumulativeYards = cumsum(WeeklyYards))\nEzekielElliot<-\n  data2021 %>% \n  filter(rusher_player_name == \"E.Elliott\" & season_type != \"POST\")%>% \n  group_by(rusher_player_name,week) %>% \n  summarise(WeeklyYards = sum(yards_gained))%>% \n  mutate(CumulativeYards = cumsum(WeeklyYards))\nElijahMitchell<-\n  data2021 %>% \n  filter(rusher_player_name == \"E.Mitchell\" & season_type != \"POST\")%>% \n  group_by(rusher_player_name,week) %>% \n  summarise(WeeklyYards = sum(yards_gained))%>% \n  mutate(CumulativeYards = cumsum(WeeklyYards))\nDamienHarris<-\n  data2021 %>% \n  filter(rusher_player_name == \"D.Harris\" & season_type != \"POST\")%>% \n  group_by(rusher_player_name,week) %>% \n  summarise(WeeklyYards = sum(yards_gained))%>% \n  mutate(CumulativeYards = cumsum(WeeklyYards))\nMelvinGordon<-\n  data2021 %>% \n  filter(rusher_player_name == \"M.Gordon\" & season_type != \"POST\")%>% \n  group_by(rusher_player_name,week) %>% \n  summarise(WeeklyYards = sum(yards_gained))%>% \n  mutate(CumulativeYards = cumsum(WeeklyYards))\nAustinEkeler<-\n  data2021 %>% \n  filter(rusher_player_name == \"A.Ekeler\"& season_type != \"POST\")%>% \n  group_by(rusher_player_name,week) %>% \n  summarise(WeeklyYards = sum(yards_gained))%>% \n  mutate(CumulativeYards = cumsum(WeeklyYards))\nJavonteWilliams<-\n  data2021 %>% \n  filter(rusher_player_name == \"J.Williams\"& season_type != \"POST\")%>% \n  group_by(rusher_player_name,week) %>% \n  summarise(WeeklyYards = sum(yards_gained))%>% \n  mutate(CumulativeYards = cumsum(WeeklyYards))\nAlvinKamara<-\n  data2021 %>% \n  filter(rusher_player_name == \"A.Kamara\"& season_type != \"POST\")%>% \n  group_by(rusher_player_name,week) %>% \n  summarise(WeeklyYards = sum(yards_gained))%>% \n  mutate(CumulativeYards = cumsum(WeeklyYards))\nJoshJacobs<-\n  data2021 %>% \n  filter(rusher_player_name == \"J.Jacobs\"& season_type != \"POST\")%>% \n  group_by(rusher_player_name,week) %>% \n  summarise(WeeklyYards = sum(yards_gained))%>% \n  mutate(CumulativeYards = cumsum(WeeklyYards))\n\nRushers2021<- \n  rbind(DerrickHenry,JohnathanTaylor, NickChubb,JoeMixon,NajeeHarris,DalvinCook,AJGibson,EzekielElliot,ElijahMitchell,DamienHarris,MelvinGordon,AustinEkeler,JavonteWilliams,AlvinKamara,JoshJacobs)\n#I am making a new dataset with the existing dataframe becuase it does not account for by weeks/weeks players do not play.

And in the NFL anything can happen, as seen with Henry’s unfortunate injury in week 8 versus Houston. Henry could have gained more than expected, he could have gained less. We just will never know what could have been.\nA common thing to help compare potential MVP material is to look to the past. Most MVPs are typically, especially in recent years, Quarterbacks. There hasn’t been a non-quarterback MVP since 2009 when Adrian Peterson had a breakout season as the Minnesota Vikings star running back. There have only been FOUR running back MVPS since 2000, so let’s look at how Derrick Henry matched up in is 2020 NFL lead rusher season and his unfortunate shortend 2021 season..\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(waffle)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nAdrianPeterson<- read_csv(\"AdrianPetersonMVPSeason.csv\")%>% \n  select(Name, Season, Week,Carries, RushYds, RushTD, Rec, RecYds, RecTD)\n\nInjuredDerrickHenry21<- read_csv(\"DerrickHenry2021SeasonInjured.csv\")%>% \n  select(Name,Season,Carries, Week,RushYds, RushTD, Rec, RecYds, RecTD)\n\nDerrickHenry20<-read_csv(\"DerrickHenry2020SeasonStats.csv\")%>% \n  select(Name,Season,Carries, Week,RushYds, RushTD, Rec, RecYds, RecTD)\n\nLaDainianTomlinson<- read_csv(\"LaDainianTomlinson2006Season.csv\")%>% \n  select(Name,Season,Carries, Week,RushYds, RushTD, Rec, RecYds, RecTD)\n\nMarshallFaulk<- read_csv(\"MarshallFaulk2000MVPSeaon.csv\")%>% \n  select(Name,Season,Carries, Week,RushYds, RushTD, Rec, RecYds, RecTD)\n\nShaunAlexander<- read_csv(\"ShaunAlexander2005MVPSeason.csv\")%>% \n  select(Name,Season,Carries, Week,RushYds, RushTD, Rec, RecYds, RecTD)\n\nEricDickerson<- read_csv(\"EricDickerson1986Season.csv\")%>% \n  select(Name,Season,Carries, Week,RushYds, RushTD, Rec, RecYds, RecTD)\n\nMVPS<-\n  rbind(AdrianPeterson,DerrickHenry20, InjuredDerrickHenry21,LaDainianTomlinson,MarshallFaulk,ShaunAlexander,EricDickerson)\n\nTotals<-\n  MVPS %>% \n  group_by(Name, Season) %>% \n  summarise(\n    `Rushing Attempts`= sum(Carries),\n    `Total Rushing Yards`=sum(RushYds),\n    `Rushing Touchdowns` = sum(RushTD),\n    Receptions = sum(Rec),\n    `Total Recieving Yards` = sum(RecYds),\n    `Recieving Touchdowns` = sum(RecTD)) %>% \n  mutate(\n    `Season Touchdowns` = (`Rushing Touchdowns` + `Recieving Touchdowns`),\n    `Season Yards` = (`Total Rushing Yards` + `Total Recieving Yards`)\n    )\n\nMVPS %>% \n  filter(Week <= 8) %>% \n  group_by(Name, Season) %>%\n  summarise(\n    `Rushing Attempts`= sum(Carries),\n    `Total Rushing Yards`=sum(RushYds),\n    `Rushing Touchdowns` = sum(RushTD),\n    Receptions = sum(Rec),\n    `Total Recieving Yards` = sum(RecYds),\n    `Recieving Touchdowns` = sum(RecTD)) %>% \n  mutate(\n    `Season Touchdowns` = (`Rushing Touchdowns` + `Recieving Touchdowns`),\n    `Season Yards` = (`Total Rushing Yards` + `Total Recieving Yards`)\n  )->`8WeekTotals`\n\n\nAP<-c(\"Rushing Yards\"=2097, \"Recieving Yards\"=217,9)\nDH20<-c(\"Rushing Yards\"=2027, \"Recieving Yards\"=114,182)\nDH21<-c(\"Rushing Yards\"=937, \"Recieving Yards\"=154,1232)\nLT<-c(\"Rushing Yards\"=1815, \"Recieving Yards\"=508)\nMF<-c(\"Rushing Yards\"=1359, \"Recieving Yards\"=830,134)\nSA<-c(\"Rushing Yards\"=1880, \"Recieving Yards\"=78,356)\nED<-c(\"Rushing Yards\"=2105, \"Recieving Yards\"=139,79)\nNN<-(c(\"Rushing Yards\"=1, \"Rushing Yards\"=1))\n\niron(\n   waffle(DH21/5,\n    rows= 10,\n    colors = c(\"#4B92DB\",\"Black\",\"white\"))+\n    labs(\n    x= \"1 square = 5 yards\",\n    title = \"Derrick Henry had a decent 8-week season in total yards\",\n    subtitle = \"Derrick Henry totaled 937 rushing yards and 154 recieving yards in 2021.\") +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title.y = element_blank()\n  ),\n  waffle(DH20/5,\n    rows= 10,\n   colors = c(\"#4B92DB\",\"Black\",\"white\"))+\n    labs(\n    x= \"1 square = 5 yards\",\n    title = \"Derrick Henry was the Season Leader in 2020\",\n    subtitle = \"Derrick Henry totaled 2027 rushing yardsa and 114 recieving yards.

What really surpises me is that Faulk had more total yards than any of the other MVPs and running backs on the list, including Eric Dickerson.\n\n\nCode\niron(\n  waffle(SA/5,\n         rows=10,\n         colors = c(\"#69BE28\",\"#002244\",\"white\"))+\n    labs(\n    x= \"1 square = 5 yards\",\n    title = \"The Seahawks running back seems to be the least productive\\nof the MVPs but still made a big impact for Seattle\",\n    subtitle = \"Suan Alexander rushed for 1880 yards and received 78 yards from Matt Hassleback.\") +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title.y = element_blank()\n  ),\n  waffle(MF/5,\n         rows=10,\n  colors = c(\"#866D4B\",\"#002244\",\"white\"))+\n  labs(\n    x= \"1 square = 5 yards\",\n    title = \"The St. Louis Rams running back helped bring the team\\nto one of the best superbowls in the modern era\",\n    subtitle = \"Marshall Faulk, while he did not play in the Superbowl, still tacked up 1359 rushing yards\\nand the most receiving yards from any running back on this list with 830 yards.\") +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title.y = element_blank()\n  ))\n\n\n\n\n\nHow did the NFL single season rushing champion do in the most dominant rushing season in the league to date? Eric Dickerson, Los Angeles Rams star running back, a.k.a. Mr. Benny, set a an abusrd record for the 80s that still holds today.

The best in over a decade in my opinion. Still through the 2022 season, Henry has SIX career games with 200+ rush yards and 2+ rushing touchdowns since 1950! Four of which are against the Houston Texans alone. He has twice as many as Hall of Famers like Barry Sanders and Jim Brown, who are not included in this post, and LaDainian Tomlinson who all have three of such games. El Tractorcito was looking to stiff arm and run over anyone who stood in his way…\nExcept breaking a bone in his foot.\nBut Derrick Henry only played 8 weeks, how can you compare less half a season to other MVP running backs? Well, lets look at how Derrick Henry’s 8 week season matches up to the MVPs. We can take Henry’s yards gained through the eight weeks and find his average yards per game was around 117.125 yards. By multiplying this over the ten games he missed, we estimate how many yards Derrick Henry could have had.

He still has many, many years to prove this in the history books, so just watch out for Derrick Henry to break the record that Eric Dickerson set over 35 years ago."

    "text": "Lets start with the basics. The Kings have missed the playoffs for 16 years as of the writing of this post. And as of 2022 have the longest professional sports playoff drought in the big 5 since the Seattle Mariners recently broke their 20-year drought in the MLB playoffs. Since the 2005-2006 season when the Kings last weaseled their way into the playoffs, I myself was only four years old, twitter was just launched, the Nintendo Wii was just released, Pluto got downgraded from Planet to “dwarf-planet” and the mockumentary Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan was released.\nJust to grasp the level of mediocrity (if you can even call it mediocre) the Sacramento Kings have reached since that point, here are some thrilling facts that make Kings fans like myself cry at night: The Kings have not breached the .500 mark, gone through 13 head and interim head coaches, built a brand new $558.2 million arena that is the beautiful Golden One Arena, changed alternative logos nine times and primary logos twice. Yay…\nOne of the most notable things that the Sacramento Kings are known for is blowing their drafts with their inevitable top ten pick every year. Since 2011, the Kings have had 26 Draft picks, 12 of which are in the first round and ten of those are in the top ten picks. In this post we will cover the failure of the Sacramento Kings front office to pull through consistently in their draft choices when they have had as much opportunity as they have had in the last decade or so.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggalt)\n\nNBAdraft<- read_csv(\"draft-data-20-years.csv\")\n\n`FirstRound00-03` <- NBAdraft %>% \n  filter(\n

The Kings would take Jimmer Fredette with their pick and recieve John Salmons in the trade. Fredette, a young star coming off of a hot season at BYU was undersized and over-hyped. Notable picks coming after the Kings initial 7th overall pick was Kemba Walker at 9, Klay Thompson at 11, and Kawhi Leonard at 15. Even Jimmy Butler was taken as the last pick in the first round. We can see just how well “The Jimmer” played out for the Kings compared to his other 2011 draft class counter parts.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nKemba<- read_csv(\"KembaWalker.csv\")\nKlay<- read_csv(\"KlayThompson.csv\")\nKawhi<- read_csv(\"KawhiLeonard.csv\")\nJimmerFixed<- read_csv(\"JimmerFixed.csv\")\n\nendKembaData<- Kemba %>% \n  filter(NBASeason == \"2022\")\nendKawhiData<- Kawhi %>% \n  filter(NBASeason == \"2021\")\nendKlayData<- Klay %>% \n  filter(NBASeason == \"2022\")\nendJimmerData<- JimmerFixed %>% \n  filter(NBASeason == \"2019\")\n\n\nggplot()+\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 2012) +\n  geom_line(\n    data=Kemba, aes(x=NBASeason,y=PTS), color=\"dark green\")+\n  geom_point(data=Kemba, aes(x=NBASeason,y=PTS), color=\"dark green\")+\n  geom_line(\n    data=Kawhi, aes(x=NBASeason,y=PTS), color=\"blue\")+\n  geom_point(data=Kawhi, aes(x=NBASeason,y=PTS), color=\"red\")+\n  geom_line(\n    data=Klay, aes(x=NBASeason,y=PTS), color=\"Yellow\")+\n  geom_point(data=Klay, aes(x=NBASeason,y=PTS), color=\"blue\")+\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 30))+\n    geom_line(\n    data=JimmerFixed, aes(x=NBASeason,y=PTS), color=\"purple\")+\n  geom_point(data=JimmerFixed, aes(x=NBASeason,y=PTS), color=\"black\")+\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 30))+\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=endKembaData, \n    aes(x=NBASeason+.2,y=PTS+.5, label=Name))+\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=endKlayData, \n    aes(x=NBASeason + 2.5, y=PTS-1, label=Name))+\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=endKawhiData, \n    aes(x=NBASeason+.5,y=PTS, label=Name))+\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=endJimmerData, \n    aes(x=NBASeason,y=PTS+1.4, label=Name))+\n  labs(title=\"Jimmer Freddette was a poor choice\\nat 7th Overall in the 2012 Draft for the Kings\", subtitle=\"Jimmer Freddette totaly underperformed in Average Points per season over his career vs his 2012 draft counterpoints\", x=\"NBA Season\", y=\"Average Points Per Season\", caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | Alex Neill\") + \n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2012,2014,2016,2018,2020,2022))+\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n   plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n2012 Draft Class\nAfter a rough 28-54 season, the Kings looked to start another rebuild year with their 5th overall pick Thomas Robinson. Sacramento fans looked hopeful for the 6’10’’ Power Forward to make moves in the Kings franchise, but just after 51 games in his rookie season, Robinson was traded to the Houston Rockets. With a career in the NBA with the Kings, Rockets, Trailblazers, Raptors, 76ers, Nets and finally the Lakers spanning a total longevity of 5 years, Robinson is easily considered one the of the Kings worst draft busts in recent years. Notable picks after Robinson would be six-time NBA allstar Damian Lillard at the 6th overall pick, Harrison Barnes (a future King player) at 7 and four picks later the star big man of the Detroit Pistons, Andre Drummond. Especially after a shorter career than his other draft class, it is easy to see why Kings fans still hurt when people bring up the 2013 NBA draft.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nPick1Davis<- read_csv(\"Pk1AnthonyDavis.csv\")\nPick2KiddGilchrist<-read_csv(\"Pk2MichaelKidd-Gillchrist.csv\")\nPick3Beal<-read_csv(\"Pk3BradleyBeal.csv\")\nPick4Waiters<-read_csv(\"Pk4DionWaiters.csv\")\nPick5Robinson<-read_csv(\"Pk5ThomasRobinson.csv\")\nPick6Lillard<-read_csv(\"Pk6DamianLlilard.csv\")\nPick7Barnes<-read_csv(\"Pk7HarrisonBarnes.csv\")\nPick8Ross<-read_csv(\"Pk8TerrenceRoss.csv\")\nPick9Drummond<-read_csv(\"Pk9AndreDrummond.csv\")\nPick10Rivers<-read_csv(\"Pk10AustinRivers.csv\")\nPick11Leonard<-read_csv(\"Pk11MeyersLeonard.csv\")\nPick12Lamb<-read_csv(\"Pk12JeremyLamb.csv\")\nPick13Marshall<-read_csv(\"Pk13KendallMarshall.csv\")\nPick14Henson<-read_csv(\"Pk14JohnHenson.csv\")\nPick15Harkless<-read_csv(\"Pk15MoHarkless.csv\")\nPick16White<-read_csv(\"Pk16RoyceWhite.csv\")\nPick17Zeller<-read_csv(\"Pk17TylerZeller.csv\")\nPick18Jones<-read_csv(\"Pk18TerrenceJones.csv\")\nPick19Nicholson<-read_csv(\"Pk19AndrewNicholson.csv\")\nPick20Fournier<-read_csv(\"Pk20EvanFournier.csv\")\nPick21Sullinger<-read_csv(\"Pk21JaredSullinger.csv\")\nPick22Melo<-read_csv(\"Pk22FabMelo.csv\")\nPick23Jenkins<-read_csv(\"Pk23JohnJenkins.csv\")\nPick24Cunningham<-read_csv(\"Pk24JaredCunningham.csv\")\nPick25Wroten<-read_csv(\"Pk25TonyWroten.csv\")\nPick26Plumlee<-read_csv(\"Pk26MilesPlumlee.csv\")\nPick27Moultrie<-read_csv(\"Pk27ArnettMoultrie.csv\")\nPick28Jones<-read_csv(\"Pk28PerryJones.csv\")\nPick29Teague<-read_csv(\"Pk29MarquisTeague.csv\")\nPick30Ezeli<-read_csv(\"Pk30FestusEzeli.csv\")\n\nplayerscareer<- rbind(Pick1Davis, Pick2KiddGilchrist, Pick3Beal, Pick4Waiters, Pick5Robinson, Pick6Lillard, Pick7Barnes, Pick8Ross, Pick9Drummond, Pick10Rivers, Pick11Leonard, Pick12Lamb, Pick13Marshall, Pick14Henson, Pick15Harkless, Pick16White, Pick17Zeller, Pick18Jones, Pick19Nicholson, Pick20Fournier, Pick21Sullinger, Pick22Melo, Pick23Jenkins, Pick24Cunningham, Pick25Wroten, Pick26Plumlee, Pick27Moultrie, Pick28Jones, Pick29Teague, Pick30Ezeli)\n\nPointsCumulative<- playerscareer %>% \n  group_by(Name) %>% \n  mutate(CumPointSum = cumsum(PTS))\n\nThomasRobinson<- PointsCumulative %>% filter(Name == \"Thomas Robinson\")\nDamianLillard<- PointsCumulative %>% filter(Name == \"Damian Lillard\")\nHarrisonBarnes<-  PointsCumulative %>% filter(Name == \"Harrison Barnes\")\nAndreDrummond<- PointsCumulative %>% filter(Name == \"Andre Drummond\")\nendRobinson<- ThomasRobinson %>% filter(NBASeason == \"2017\")\nendLillard<- DamianLillard %>% filter(NBASeason == \"2022\")\nendBarnes<- HarrisonBarnes %>% filter(NBASeason == \"2022\")\nendDrummond<- AndreDrummond %>% filter(NBASeason == \"2022\")\n\nggplot()+\n  geom_step(data=PointsCumulative, aes(x=NBASeason, y=CumPointSum, group=Name), color=\"light grey\")+\n  geom_step(data=HarrisonBarnes, aes(x=NBASeason, y=CumPointSum, group=Name), color=\"Blue\")+\n  geom_step(data=AndreDrummond, aes(x=NBASeason, y=CumPointSum, group=Name), color=\"Maroon\")+\n  geom_step(data=DamianLillard, aes(x=NBASeason, y=CumPointSum, group=Name), color=\"Red\")+\n  geom_step(data=ThomasRobinson, aes(x=NBASeason, y=CumPointSum, group=Name), color=\"Purple\")+\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=endRobinson, aes(x=NBASeason,y=CumPointSum+250, label=Name))+\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=endLillard, aes(x=NBASeason+.5,y=CumPointSum-400, label=Name))+\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=endBarnes, aes(x=NBASeason,y=CumPointSum+400, label=Name))+\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=endDrummond, aes(x=NBASeason+1.3,y=CumPointSum-1250, label=Name))+\n  labs(title=\"Thomas Robinson was not worth his\\ntop 5 draft spot for the Kings\", subtitle=\"The cumulative points over the course of all rookies in 2012 Draft show that Robinson was a bust\", x=\"NBA Season\", y=\"Points Scored\", caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | Alex Neill\") + \n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2013,2015,2017,2019,2021))+\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n   plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n2014 Draft Class\nTwo years after the Thomas Robinson mess, the Kings select Nik Staustkas, the 6’6’’ shooting guard out of Michigan. The problem with this pick would become a familiar sight for Kings fans. Sacramento had just drafted a player the year prior in Ben McLemore that was already producing a decent presence as the Kings Shooting Guard. Then GM Pete D’Alessandro, brought in sports analytic experts to help with the choice on draft night spending tens of thousands of dollars on assistance. These experts advised the Kings to take Elfrid Payton who would fit better with the Kings play style and overall in the team. Now, Staustkas is not one of those picks like before with Hall-of-fame level players coming after him, but Payton would have been a much smarter choice for the kings, especially on the money completely wasted after the front office blatantly ignored all the advice that the sports data experts gave. Here is just the rookie season of both Staustkas and Payton compared to their college careers.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nPercentages<-read_csv(\"PaytonStauskasPercentages.csv\")\nPerGameTotals<-read_csv(\"PerGameTotals.csv\")\n\nggplot(data=Percentages, aes(x=Stat, weight=Efficiency, fill= Leauge,))+\n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\")+  \n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"#C9082A\",\"#005eb8\"))+\n    guides(fill = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE))+\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)+\n  coord_flip()+\n  facet_wrap(~Name)+\n  labs(\n    title=\"Percentage-wise, it looks as if the Kings finally\\nmade a good draft pick!

The draft that I hear about a couple times a month from my peers teasing me for the choice of the Kings. Sacramento, yet again wins a top-5 draft choice in the lottery and Kings fans, like myself, were already dreading the selection knowing that it would be a bust and the curse would continue. The fateful words came out of NBA commissioner Adam Silver, “With the No. 2 pick in the 2018 NBA draft, the Sacramento Kings select Marvin Bagley III, Duke.” The boos ensued. The next pick the Atlanta hawks picked Luka Doncic and later traded with the Mavericks for their No. 5 selection of Trae Young out of Oklahoma. Seeing the kings select, what was definitely a promising Power Forward, Marvin Bagley when there was literally anyone to pick from was heartbreaking. A generational talent in Luka Doncic that critics were raving over and the incredible range that Trae Young had for the Sooners and Sacramento picked a power forward that probably should have gone in the top 15 picks. Nonetheless, just comparing looking at all the 1st rounders from 2018 we can see that the Bagley III pick, yet again, did not turn in favor of the Kings.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\n\nDraftClass2018<- read_csv(\"draft-data-20-years.csv\")\n\nDraftClass2018 %>% \n  filter(\n    DraftYear == \"2018\",\n    Pk <31) %>% \n  select(\n    Player,Pk,Tm,G,TOTPTS,`FG%`,`3P%`,TOTTRB,TOTAST) %>% \n  gt() %>% \n  cols_label(\n    G = \"Games Played\",\n    `FG%` = \"Feild Goal Percentage\",\n    `3P%` = \"Three Point Percentage\",\n    TOTPTS = \"Career Points\",\n    TOTTRB = \"Career Rebounds\",\n    TOTAST = \"Career Assists\",\n    Pk = \"2018 Draft Position\",\n    Tm= \"Drafting Team\"\n  ) %>% \n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Marvin Bagley III did not compete like a top-3 pick for Sacramento.
