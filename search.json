    "text": "Lets start with the basics. The Kings have missed the playoffs for 16 years as of the writing of this post. And as of 2022 have the longest professional sports playoff drought in the big 5 since the Seattle Mariners recently broke their 20-year drought in the MLB playoffs. Since the 2005-2006 season when the Kings last weaseled their way into the playoffs, I myself was only four years old, twitter was just launched, the Nintendo Wii was just released, Pluto got downgraded from Planet to “dwarf-planet” and the mockumentary Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan was released.\nJust to grasp the level of mediocrity (if you can even call it mediocre) the Sacramento Kings have reached since that point, here are some thrilling facts that make Kings fans like myself cry at night: The Kings have not breached the .500 mark, gone through 13 head and interim head coaches, built a brand new $558.2 million arena that is the beautiful Golden One Arena, changed alternative logos nine times and primary logos twice. Yay…\nOne of the most notable things that the Sacramento Kings are known for is blowing their drafts with their inevitable top ten pick every year. Since 2011, the Kings have had 26 Draft picks, 12 of which are in the first round and ten of those are in the top ten picks. In this post we will cover the failure of the Sacramento Kings front office to pull through consistently in their draft choices when they have had as much opportunity as they have had in the last decade or so.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggalt)\n\nNBAdraft<- read_csv(\"draft-data-20-years.csv\")\n\n`FirstRound00-03` <- NBAdraft %>% \n  filter(\n

The Kings would take Jimmer Fredette with their pick and recieve John Salmons in the trade. Fredette, a young star coming off of a hot season at BYU was undersized and over-hyped. Notable picks coming after the Kings initial 7th overall pick was Kemba Walker at 9, Klay Thompson at 11, and Kawhi Leonard at 15. Even Jimmy Butler was taken as the last pick in the first round. We can see just how well “The Jimmer” played out for the Kings compared to his other 2011 draft class counter parts.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nKemba<- read_csv(\"KembaWalker.csv\")\nKlay<- read_csv(\"KlayThompson.csv\")\nKawhi<- read_csv(\"KawhiLeonard.csv\")\nJimmerFixed<- read_csv(\"JimmerFixed.csv\")\n\nendKembaData<- Kemba %>% \n  filter(NBASeason == \"2022\")\nendKawhiData<- Kawhi %>% \n  filter(NBASeason == \"2021\")\nendKlayData<- Klay %>% \n  filter(NBASeason == \"2022\")\nendJimmerData<- JimmerFixed %>% \n  filter(NBASeason == \"2019\")\n\n\nggplot()+\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 2012) +\n  geom_line(\n    data=Kemba, aes(x=NBASeason,y=PTS), color=\"dark green\")+\n  geom_point(data=Kemba, aes(x=NBASeason,y=PTS), color=\"dark green\")+\n  geom_line(\n    data=Kawhi, aes(x=NBASeason,y=PTS), color=\"blue\")+\n  geom_point(data=Kawhi, aes(x=NBASeason,y=PTS), color=\"red\")+\n  geom_line(\n    data=Klay, aes(x=NBASeason,y=PTS), color=\"Yellow\")+\n  geom_point(data=Klay, aes(x=NBASeason,y=PTS), color=\"blue\")+\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 30))+\n    geom_line(\n    data=JimmerFixed, aes(x=NBASeason,y=PTS), color=\"purple\")+\n  geom_point(data=JimmerFixed, aes(x=NBASeason,y=PTS), color=\"black\")+\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 30))+\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=endKembaData, \n    aes(x=NBASeason+.2,y=PTS+.5, label=Name))+\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=endKlayData, \n    aes(x=NBASeason + 2.5, y=PTS-1, label=Name))+\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=endKawhiData, \n    aes(x=NBASeason+.5,y=PTS, label=Name))+\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=endJimmerData, \n    aes(x=NBASeason,y=PTS+1.4, label=Name))+\n  labs(title=\"Jimmer Freddette was a poor choice\\nat 7th Overall in the 2012 Draft for the Kings\", subtitle=\"Jimmer Freddette totaly underperformed in Average Points per season over his career vs his 2012 draft counterpoints\", x=\"NBA Season\", y=\"Average Points Per Season\", caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | Alex Neill\") + \n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2012,2014,2016,2018,2020,2022))+\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n   plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n2012 Draft Class\nAfter a rough 28-54 season, the Kings looked to start another rebuild year with their 5th overall pick Thomas Robinson. Sacramento fans looked hopeful for the 6’10’’ Power Forward to make moves in the Kings franchise, but just after 51 games in his rookie season, Robinson was traded to the Houston Rockets. With a career in the NBA with the Kings, Rockets, Trailblazers, Raptors, 76ers, Nets and finally the Lakers spanning a total longevity of 5 years, Robinson is easily considered one the of the Kings worst draft busts in recent years. Notable picks after Robinson would be six-time NBA allstar Damian Lillard at the 6th overall pick, Harrison Barnes (a future King player) at 7 and four picks later the star big man of the Detroit Pistons, Andre Drummond. Especially after a shorter career than his other draft class, it is easy to see why Kings fans still hurt when people bring up the 2013 NBA draft.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nPick1Davis<- read_csv(\"Pk1AnthonyDavis.csv\")\nPick2KiddGilchrist<-read_csv(\"Pk2MichaelKidd-Gillchrist.csv\")\nPick3Beal<-read_csv(\"Pk3BradleyBeal.csv\")\nPick4Waiters<-read_csv(\"Pk4DionWaiters.csv\")\nPick5Robinson<-read_csv(\"Pk5ThomasRobinson.csv\")\nPick6Lillard<-read_csv(\"Pk6DamianLlilard.csv\")\nPick7Barnes<-read_csv(\"Pk7HarrisonBarnes.csv\")\nPick8Ross<-read_csv(\"Pk8TerrenceRoss.csv\")\nPick9Drummond<-read_csv(\"Pk9AndreDrummond.csv\")\nPick10Rivers<-read_csv(\"Pk10AustinRivers.csv\")\nPick11Leonard<-read_csv(\"Pk11MeyersLeonard.csv\")\nPick12Lamb<-read_csv(\"Pk12JeremyLamb.csv\")\nPick13Marshall<-read_csv(\"Pk13KendallMarshall.csv\")\nPick14Henson<-read_csv(\"Pk14JohnHenson.csv\")\nPick15Harkless<-read_csv(\"Pk15MoHarkless.csv\")\nPick16White<-read_csv(\"Pk16RoyceWhite.csv\")\nPick17Zeller<-read_csv(\"Pk17TylerZeller.csv\")\nPick18Jones<-read_csv(\"Pk18TerrenceJones.csv\")\nPick19Nicholson<-read_csv(\"Pk19AndrewNicholson.csv\")\nPick20Fournier<-read_csv(\"Pk20EvanFournier.csv\")\nPick21Sullinger<-read_csv(\"Pk21JaredSullinger.csv\")\nPick22Melo<-read_csv(\"Pk22FabMelo.csv\")\nPick23Jenkins<-read_csv(\"Pk23JohnJenkins.csv\")\nPick24Cunningham<-read_csv(\"Pk24JaredCunningham.csv\")\nPick25Wroten<-read_csv(\"Pk25TonyWroten.csv\")\nPick26Plumlee<-read_csv(\"Pk26MilesPlumlee.csv\")\nPick27Moultrie<-read_csv(\"Pk27ArnettMoultrie.csv\")\nPick28Jones<-read_csv(\"Pk28PerryJones.csv\")\nPick29Teague<-read_csv(\"Pk29MarquisTeague.csv\")\nPick30Ezeli<-read_csv(\"Pk30FestusEzeli.csv\")\n\nplayerscareer<- rbind(Pick1Davis, Pick2KiddGilchrist, Pick3Beal, Pick4Waiters, Pick5Robinson, Pick6Lillard, Pick7Barnes, Pick8Ross, Pick9Drummond, Pick10Rivers, Pick11Leonard, Pick12Lamb, Pick13Marshall, Pick14Henson, Pick15Harkless, Pick16White, Pick17Zeller, Pick18Jones, Pick19Nicholson, Pick20Fournier, Pick21Sullinger, Pick22Melo, Pick23Jenkins, Pick24Cunningham, Pick25Wroten, Pick26Plumlee, Pick27Moultrie, Pick28Jones, Pick29Teague, Pick30Ezeli)\n\nPointsCumulative<- playerscareer %>% \n  group_by(Name) %>% \n  mutate(CumPointSum = cumsum(PTS))\n\nThomasRobinson<- PointsCumulative %>% filter(Name == \"Thomas Robinson\")\nDamianLillard<- PointsCumulative %>% filter(Name == \"Damian Lillard\")\nHarrisonBarnes<-  PointsCumulative %>% filter(Name == \"Harrison Barnes\")\nAndreDrummond<- PointsCumulative %>% filter(Name == \"Andre Drummond\")\nendRobinson<- ThomasRobinson %>% filter(NBASeason == \"2017\")\nendLillard<- DamianLillard %>% filter(NBASeason == \"2022\")\nendBarnes<- HarrisonBarnes %>% filter(NBASeason == \"2022\")\nendDrummond<- AndreDrummond %>% filter(NBASeason == \"2022\")\n\nggplot()+\n  geom_step(data=PointsCumulative, aes(x=NBASeason, y=CumPointSum, group=Name), color=\"light grey\")+\n  geom_step(data=HarrisonBarnes, aes(x=NBASeason, y=CumPointSum, group=Name), color=\"Blue\")+\n  geom_step(data=AndreDrummond, aes(x=NBASeason, y=CumPointSum, group=Name), color=\"Maroon\")+\n  geom_step(data=DamianLillard, aes(x=NBASeason, y=CumPointSum, group=Name), color=\"Red\")+\n  geom_step(data=ThomasRobinson, aes(x=NBASeason, y=CumPointSum, group=Name), color=\"Purple\")+\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=endRobinson, aes(x=NBASeason,y=CumPointSum+250, label=Name))+\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=endLillard, aes(x=NBASeason+.5,y=CumPointSum-400, label=Name))+\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=endBarnes, aes(x=NBASeason,y=CumPointSum+400, label=Name))+\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=endDrummond, aes(x=NBASeason+1.3,y=CumPointSum-1250, label=Name))+\n  labs(title=\"Thomas Robinson was not worth his\\ntop 5 draft spot for the Kings\", subtitle=\"The cumulative points over the course of all rookies in 2012 Draft show that Robinson was a bust\", x=\"NBA Season\", y=\"Points Scored\", caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | Alex Neill\") + \n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2013,2015,2017,2019,2021))+\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n   plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n2014 Draft Class\nTwo years after the Thomas Robinson mess, the Kings select Nik Staustkas, the 6’6’’ shooting guard out of Michigan. The problem with this pick would become a familiar sight for Kings fans. Sacramento had just drafted a player the year prior in Ben McLemore that was already producing a decent presence as the Kings Shooting Guard. Then GM Pete D’Alessandro, brought in sports analytic experts to help with the choice on draft night spending tens of thousands of dollars on assistance. These experts advised the Kings to take Elfrid Payton who would fit better with the Kings play style and overall in the team. Now, Staustkas is not one of those picks like before with Hall-of-fame level players coming after him, but Payton would have been a much smarter choice for the kings, especially on the money completely wasted after the front office blatantly ignored all the advice that the sports data experts gave. Here is just the rookie season of both Staustkas and Payton compared to their college careers.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nPercentages<-read_csv(\"PaytonStauskasPercentages.csv\")\nPerGameTotals<-read_csv(\"PerGameTotals.csv\")\n\nggplot(data=Percentages, aes(x=Stat, weight=Efficiency, fill= Leauge,))+\n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\")+  \n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"#C9082A\",\"#005eb8\"))+\n    guides(fill = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE))+\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)+\n  coord_flip()+\n  facet_wrap(~Name)+\n  labs(\n    title=\"Percentage-wise, it looks as if the Kings finally\\nmade a good draft pick!

Sacramento, yet again wins a top-5 draft choice in the lottery and Kings fans, like myself, were already dreading the selection knowing that it would be a bust and the curse would continue. The fateful words came out of NBA commissioner Adam Silver, “With the No. 2 pick in the 2018 NBA draft, the Sacramento Kings select Marvin Bagley III, Duke.” The boos ensued. The next pick the Atlanta hawks picked Luka Doncic and later traded with the Mavericks for their No. 5 selection of Trae Young out of Oklahoma. Seeing the kings select, what was definitely a promising Power Forward, Marvin Bagley when there was literally anyone to pick from was heartbreaking. A generational talent in Luka Doncic that critics were raving over and the incredible range that Trae Young had for the Sooners and Sacramento picked a power forward that probably should have gone in the top 15 picks. Nonetheless, just comparing looking at all the 1st rounders from 2018 we can see that the Bagley III pick, yet again, did not turn in favor of the Kings.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\n\nDraftClass2018<- read_csv(\"draft-data-20-years.csv\")\n\nDraftClass2018 %>% \n  filter(\n    DraftYear == \"2018\",\n    Pk <31) %>% \n  select(\n    Player,Pk,Tm,G,TOTPTS,`FG%`,`3P%`,TOTTRB,TOTAST) %>% \n  gt() %>% \n  cols_label(\n    G = \"Games Played\",\n    `FG%` = \"Feild Goal Percentage\",\n    `3P%` = \"Three Point Percentage\",\n    TOTPTS = \"Career Points\",\n    TOTTRB = \"Career Rebounds\",\n    TOTAST = \"Career Assists\",\n    Pk = \"2018 Draft Position\",\n    Tm= \"Drafting Team\"\n  ) %>% \n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Marvin Bagley III did not compete like a top-3 pick for Sacramento.
