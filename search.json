    "text": "Simply missing out on drafting a star that ends up becoming way better than projected does not mean that a team fails on a pick, but when they repeatedly miss out on high-end talent, consistently busting their draft picks, and failing to develop their young players into stars that is a pattern of failure by an NBA team. That team that is the pinnacle of bad drafting is the Sacramento Kings. The data from the players that the Kings drafted verses their fellow draft class players is astounding.\nLets start with the basics. The Kings have missed the playoffs for 16 years as of the writing of this post. And as of 2022 have the longest professional sports playoff drought in the big 5 since the Seattle Mariners recently broke their 20-year drought in the MLB playoffs. Since the 2005-2006 season when the Kings last weaseled their way into the playoffs, I myself was only four years old, twitter was just launched, the Nintendo Wii was just released, Pluto got downgraded from Planet to “dwarf-planet” and the mockumentary Borat was released.\nJust to grasp the level of mediocrity (if you can even call it mediocre) the Sacramento Kings have reached since that point here are some thrilling facts that make Kings fans like myself cry at night: The Kings have not breached the .500 mark, gone through 13 head and interim head coaches, built a brand new $558.2 million arena that is the beautiful Golden One Arena, changed alternative logos nine times and primary logos twice. Yay…\nOne of the most notable things that the Sacramento Kings are known for is blowing their drafts with their inevitable top ten pick every year. Since 2011, the Kings have had 26 Draft picks, 12 of which are in the first round and ten of those are in the top ten picks. In this post we will cover the failure of the Sacramento Kings front office to pull through consistently in their draft choices when they have had as much opportunity as they have had in the last decade or so.\nCHART\n2011 Draft Class\nThe Kings select Bismack Biyombo with the 7th pick and immediately trade him to the Charlotte Bobcats for the 10th overall pick in a three-team trade with Milwaukee. The Kings would get Jimmer Fredette with their pick and John Salmons. Fredette, a young star coming off of a hot season at BYU was undersized and over-hyped. Notable picks coming after the Kings initial 7th overall pick was Kemba Walker at 9, Klay Thompson at 11, and Kawhi Leonard at 15. Even Jimmy Butler was taken as the last pick in the first round. We can see just how well “The Jimmer” played out for the Kings compared to his other 2011 draft class counter parts.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n── Attaching packages
